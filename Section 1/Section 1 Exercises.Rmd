## Exercise 1 - reformatting spectra dataset 

Load all the `.jdx` files of the `fusel alcohols` dataset into individual variables. Then:

1.  Find the units of the propanol IR spectra (e.g. is the y-axis in absorbance or transmittance?)

2.  Isolate the spectra of each compound into new variables.

3.  Compile all the spectra into a single variable. What type of data structure is best for this purpose?

4.  Save the compiled spectra to a `.rds` file.

## Exercise 2 - calculating rate constants

The combustion reaction of heptane is described by the equation:

$$
C_7H_{16} + O_2 \rightarrow products
$$

The rate constant of this reaction follows the Arrhenius Equation with a pre-exponential factor of `5.25*10^-7` cm3/mol\*s and an activation energy of `181` kJ/mol ([NIST](https://kinetics.nist.gov/kinetics/Detail?id=1975SHA/DEN872:4)). Calculate the rate constant at: 410K, 420K and 430K.

## Exercise 3 - calculating density with CEoS

The density of carbon dioxide is well approximated by the Peng-Robinson EoS. The critical point is 304.2K and 7.38 MPa, and the acentric factor is 0.224 (table 2-106 of "Perry's Chemical Engineers Handbook" 9th edition).

Calculate the compressibility factor and the density of CO2 under the conditions:

1.  300K, and pressures 0.1 to 1.0 MPa (with steps of 0.1MPa)

2.  450K and pressures 8.0, 9.0 and 10 MPa
